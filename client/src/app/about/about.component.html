            <h1>Welcome to <strong>Feater</strong></h1>
            <p>Feater is a tool for <strong>rapid deployment</strong> of selected <strong>features</strong> of your web application to <strong>isolated testing or demo environments</strong>.</p>
            <p><strong>It’s tech-agnostic.</strong><br>It can be used regardless of languages or dependencies used in your project. This is possible because it uses Docker containers and Docker Compose configurations.</p>
            <p><strong>It’s open-source.</strong><br>It's released under MIT license. You can use it for free as well as modify it to suit your needs.</p>
            <p><strong>It’s easy to use.</strong><br>If your project has a Docker Compose setup and some build scripts you won't need much more to run it with Feater.</p>
            <p><strong>It’s easy to host.</strong><br>It runs in Docker containers and you can use it on your local machine or set up a dedicated server for it.</p>
